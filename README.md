## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Netflix Titles dataset** (Movies + TV Shows) using **SQL Server** for data analysis and **Power BI** for visualization. The goal was to transform raw metadata into actionable business insights that highlight Netflix‚Äôs global content strategy.

---

## üîé What We Built

- A set of **SQL queries** to explore and answer critical business questions such as:
  - How many movies vs TV shows are available?
  - Which countries contribute the most content?
  - What are the dominant genres and ratings?
  - How has content production evolved over the years?
  - Who are the most frequent directors and contributors?

- A summary SQL View `vw_netflix_summary` that consolidates multiple insights into a single reference table.

- A fully interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that visualizes:
  - KPIs like total titles, average duration, total countries, and genres
  - Movies vs TV Shows distribution (both count & percentage)
  - Yearly release trends (growth of content over time)
  - Genre and Rating breakdowns
  - Geographic content distribution across top contributing countries

---

## üéØ Why This Project?

Netflix has a vast and diverse library. By analyzing its catalog:

- Business teams can understand content distribution trends.
- Analysts can identify dominant genres, ratings, and countries.
- Stakeholders can track growth patterns and production strategies.

This project demonstrates how to apply **SQL for backend analytics** and **Power BI for storytelling dashboards** ‚Äî bridging raw data and business decisions.
