## 📌 Project Overview

The project demonstrates how raw Netflix titles data can be analyzed using **SQL queries** and visualized in **Power BI dashboards**.  

Key aspects include:  
- Writing **SQL queries** to analyze movies, TV shows, ratings, genres, and countries.  
- Creating **views, aggregations, joins, CTEs, and window functions** in SQL.  
- Building a **Power BI dashboard** with KPIs, charts, slicers, and filters.  
- Delivering insights into **top genres, country trends, longest movies, and release patterns**.

## 📊 SQL Analysis Performed

Some of the SQL queries used in this project include:  

1. Count how many **Movies vs TV Shows** are available.  
2. Find the **Top 5 countries** with the most titles.  
3. Get the total number of titles released **each year**.  
4. Show the **average movie duration**.  
5. List all titles released in the same year as *Breaking Bad*.  
6. Get the **latest added title per country** using window functions.  
7. Find **directors with more than 5 titles**.  
8. Count titles for each **rating category**.  
9. Get the **Top 3 longest movies**.  
10. Find all titles that include **‘love’** in their name.  
11. Use a **CTE** to filter TV Shows released after 2015 with rating `TV-MA`.  
12. Count **unique directors per country**.  
13. Find the country with the **highest average release year** for movies.  
14. Rank movies by **duration using RANK()** function.  
15. Create a **SQL summary view** consolidating Netflix insights.
